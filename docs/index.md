# Welcome to the STLP Engineering Site!
## What is STLP?

The Kentucky Department of Education’s Student Technology Leadership Program (STLP) uses project-based learning principles to empower student learning and achievement. STLP provides a means for student to design, make, connect and learn through technology utilization and creation of original digital content.

Student products, projects, and services are showcased through local, regional, and state events. The “Big 3” events include Regionals, DPOJ, and STLP State Championship.

Open and available to every K-12 student in Kentucky,
STLP is more than a club… it’s your whole school!

## What is the STLP Engineering/Ambassador Program?

The honor of being an STLP Engineer/Ambassador is given only to a select few every year, students from all over the state send in an application and it is judged and your host of some of the brightest young minds in the state are selected to be an Engineer.

This years group of Engineers have taken a trip to the Kentucky Department of Education to participate in a State-Wide CIO call and learn more about the inner workings that go into the network that keeps our state education system running!

They are also your tech support here at KySTE! In addition to being tech support at STLP State in April!
